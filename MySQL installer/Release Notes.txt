MYSQL INSTALLER 1.6
--------------------
1.6.11 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed the authentication method that MySQL Installer uses for accessing the My Oracle Support (MOS) website to permit 
  downloading commercial MySQL products, which incorrectly parsed special characters in the Single Sign On (SSO) password.
* MySQL Installer could not upgrade from MySQL Server 8.0.0-8.0.11 as the MSI for those versions remove the Windows MySQL service 
  during an upgrade or uninstall operation. Now MySQL Installer shows the Windows service configuration page during an upgrade from 
  these old MySQL versions, and provides an option to either create the Windows service or proceed with the server being run as a 
  process.
* The Removing Windows Firewall step would fail if the my.ini file was missing a mysqlx_port definition.
* Removed download support for product versions that reached End of Life (EoL), including: MySQL Server 5.7 and earlier, MySQL Shell 
  1.0, MySQL Router 2.x, MySQL NDB Cluster 7.4 and earlier, MySQL Cluster Manager 1.x, MySQL Enterprise Backup 4.1 and earlier, 
  MySQL Utilities, MySQL Workbench 6.3 and earlier, MySQL Enterprise Monitor 4.0 and earlier, MySQL Notifier, MySQL for Excel, 
  MySQL for Visual Studio, and documentation specific to the EoL versions.
* Clicking the [X] close button on a wizard's page now yields a confirmation popup if the wizard is busy executing an operation.
* The status indicator for the product removal selector would not update under certain conditions.
* The server_type variable was removed from the generated MySQL Server configuration file, because it was only relevant to MySQL 
  Installer. This information is now stored in the MySQL Installer settings-{license}.xml file.
* Removed download support for all connectors. The Installer still detects existing connector installations and allows uninstalling
  them, but they cannot be installed or upgraded. Instead, install and upgrade each connector from the MySQL Downloads page. The 
  latest MySQL connector version supports all active MySQL Server versions. For example, MySQL Connector/Python 9.0.0 supports 
  and is recommended for MySQL 8.0, 8.4, and 9.0.


1.6.10 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a couple of broken links in the Resources Links section of the About page.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the --silent option would still prompt for user input when there was no internet connection
  and offline mode was disabled.
* Updated the configuration templates to set the mysqlx_port server variable instead of loose_mysqlx_port when creating or 
  updating the my.ini configuration file.
* Updated PE (exe, dll, msi) files to include the correct license metadata. The ProductName field was adjusted to not include 
  the license as part of the name and to be the same for all PE files. The product description was moved from the Comments field 
  to the FileDescription field and the LegalTrademarks field was set for all PE files. This metadata can be inspected by using 
  the VersionInfo Powershell command or similar tool.


1.6.9 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where the installation context defined by standalone MSI files was sometimes being altered by MySQL Installer during
  an install or upgrade operation.
* Fixed a bug where authenticating into My Oracle Support (MOS) was no longer possible due to changes in the MOS website. This 
  prevented from downloading commercial MySQL products.


1.6.8 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed any warnings from the MySQL Server 8.0 error log generated during a server configuration except for the expected 
  MY-010068 warning entry.


1.6.7 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug in the Select Features wizard page where it was possible to unselect child features even if the parent feature 
  was marked as required.
* Updated server templates to remove the use of the "“" and "”" utf-8 characters as these are not supported in Workbench and
  would prevent my.ini files generated using said templates from being loaded.


1.6.6 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added support for installing both 32 and 64 bit variants of Connector/ODBC and Connector/C++.
* Added an Offline mode that enables users to run MySQL Installer with all internet functionality disabled. Users without an 
  internet connection can use this mode to prevent MySQL Installer from automatically attempting to download the latest manifest 
  and the MySQL products not found in the product cache. Only products found in the product cache can be installed when this 
  mode is enabled. When started, MySQL Installer prompts the user to enable offline mode if it finds no internet connection. 
  Option is available within the General tab of the MySQL Installer options dialog.
* Made enhancements to the download of MySQL products. Failed downloads are now retried up to 3 times for failures caused
  by interrupted or incomplete downloads. Also, the algorithm now automatically adjusts the number of allowed concurrent
  downloads if the failures are caused by an excess of concurrent downloads.
* Fixed a bug in which it was incorrectly determined if the installation of a MySQL product was expected to be per-machine or
  per-user. This issue would prevent the new installation from identifying the old installation, which resulted in a faulty
  installation/upgrade.
* Fixed a bug where the selected authentication method was not being persisted, resulting in failed configurations when 
  selecting an authentication method other than the default.
* Fixed a memory leak issue where web client instances were not being correctly disposed and improved the memory usage by
  reusing web clients instances for product downloads where possible.
* Fixed two issues where it was not possible to use certain characters as part of the password for the root account. This was 
  not consistent with what is supported by the MySQL Server product by default.
* Fixed a bug where passwords provided during a server configuration were incorrectly being sanitized, resulting in the text
  provided by the user being altered as the passwords were being typed.


1.6.5 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where the server error log was not given the correct permissions when a custom path was provided by the user.
* Fixed a bug where it was not possible to create a MySQL user with the DB designer role during a server configuration due
  to the mysql.proc table no longer existing in MySQL Server 8.0.
* Fixed a bug where the server configuration would fail if the user specified a service account other than the default Network 
  Service account because the correct permissions to access the server files were not being granted.
* Fixed a bug where it was possible to assign the same named pipe name to multiple versions of the server from different 
  series resulting in the configuration failing.
* Fixed a bug where the "Starting the server" configuration step would run indefinitely because it did not validate the state 
  of the Windows service. The service not running can be caused by multiple reasons and it made sense that the step would fail 
  eventually if the service failed to start.
* Fixed a bug where the server configuration type specified in the Type and Networking configuration page was not persistent
  when attempting to reconfigure the server.
* Slightly reduced the installation time of all MySQL products. This is more noticeable with large MSIs and/or MSIs that have 
  been previously installed.
* Improved the automatic catalog download by also allowing the product catalog to be applied even if the version numbers are 
  not compatible but MySQL Installer is still missing the full product catalog.
* Updated the server configuration templates to use the latest descriptions and default values when the server is being 
  configured.
* Improved the download of MySQL products by including a retry all button to retry any failed downloads as well as fixed a
  bug where the Try Again link for a failed download re-triggered all failed downloads instead of just the one that was
  selected.
* Added a new server configuration type called Manual, which allows users to keep the default values assigned to the server
  variables instead of attempting to optimize them. This enables users to have full control on deciding which variables to
  update.
* Added support to configure an HTTP proxy. Proxy details can be retrieved automatically from the system settings or can be 
  manually provided by the user who configures the proxy with the MySQL Installer options dialog. Although .NET does not yet 
  support HTTPS proxies, connections made with MySQL Installer are secure and it is possible to execute HTTP/HTTPS requests
  through an HTTP proxy server.


1.6.4 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Re-architected the CLI (mysqlinstallerconsole.exe) to follow a consistent syntax and naming convention for actions
  and options and to have a better correspondence with the naming conventions used by MySQL Server and MySQL Shell.
  This change also fixed several bugs where some configuration options and features were available when running
  MySQL Installer in UI mode but not in the CLI.
* Improved the performance of installing, upgrading and removing MySQL products. Some products would cause a performance
  degradation when the MSIs were being executed due to the mishandling of resources when updating the UI. This was
  particularly notorious with products such as MySQL Shell and MySQL Workbench. Performance for affected products has now
  been improved in over 50%.
* A new server configuration page has been added to simplify the access management of files in the data directory.
* Added support for the configuration of MySQL Router when using the CLI.
* Added support for setting the X Protocol port during a server configuration via the mysqlx_port configuration argument
  when using the CLI.
* Added support for enabling or disabling the automatic product catalog updates when using the CLI.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the console output failed to indicate that no features will be modified if the selected
  features are already in the selected install/remove states.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where attempting to install and already installed product would result in an error that did not
  disclose the product that caused the conflict.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where a missing space would concatenate the "failed!" or "done!" messages with the name of the
  affected product. The messages were also updated to be upper-case.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where it was no longer possible to create MySQL users during a server reconfiguration.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the --silent option would still prompt for user input in multiple scenarios.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the -show-settings option would fail to execute for non-installed products.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where it was possible to install already installed products or other versions of the same
  product with the --install action. This would sometimes corrupt existing installations.
* Fixed a bug in the commercial CLI to request MOS credentials when attempting to download a product if the credentials
  had not yet been provided.
* Fixed a bug that prevented determining correctly if the user is running MySQL Installer in a 32 or 64 bit OS. This would
  cause incorrect packages to be selected for installation in some scenarios.
* Updated the server configuration templates to use the default value of the innodb_buffer_pool_size server variable to 128m.


1.6.3 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where configuring a MySQL Server to only support the Named Pipe protocol failed because the connection
  attempts would fail.
* Added the Named Pipe wizard page to support the configuration of the named_pipe_full_access_group server system
  variable.
* Fixed a bug where the MySQL command line shortcut created during a MySQL Server installation would not work when
  Named Pipe was the only protocol enabled.
* Fixed a bug where the installation directory and/or data directory (in the case of MySQL Server) were not being
  validated properly in the Advanced Options dialog.
* Fixed a bug that improves the validations of the binary log path in the Logging Options wizard page.
* Corrected the Client Only setup type description to match the products that are actually being installed.
* Fixed a bug where the merging of product catalogs would append new packages instead of prepending them to the list.
  This caused the CLI to recommend the newest package as the last option during a MySQL product installation operation.
* Fixed a bug preventing the MOS credentials to be correctly validated in the My Oracle Support Authentication dialog
  when performing a catalog update for the commercial version of MySQL Installer.
* Fixed a bug where the sakila and world databases installed as part of the Samples & Examples product were outdated and
  used the wrong encoding when running the SQL scripts.
* Fixed a bug in the Download wizard page which indicated that the products were being installed when in reality they were
  being downloaded.
* Updated the templates used for generating the my.ini server options file to correctly state the expected location of
  the my.ini file when MySQL Server was installed using MySQL Installer.


1.6.2 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Added support for installing MySQL products other than MySQL Server into paths that contain unicode characters.
  This is a known limitation of MySQL Server.
* Fixed a bug in the Select Features wizard page preventing the default features to be correctly identified.
* Removed the innodb_open_files option from the configuration templates since it is now automatically calculated by
  the server.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where using the showsettings option resulted in an unhandled exception.
* Fixed a bug in the Upgrade Available dialog shown during a catalog update which caused the close button to be
  interpreted as accepting the upgrade.
* Fixed a bug where the most recent product catalog was not applied if the user accepted an upgrade when performing
  a catalog update.
* Added missing information about the MEB product to the applicable setup types in the Choosing a Setup Page wizard page
  for the commercial version of MySQL Installer.
* Fixed a bug where the now unused scheduled task was still being created by the MySQL Installer MSI.
* Updated the default number of days to check for catalog updates to 1 and fixed a bug where resetting this value in the
  MySQL Installer options did not work.


1.6.1 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Updated multiple broken links found in the Installation Complete page.
* Updated the MySQL Server 8.0.27+ configuration templates to replace the use of the default_authentication_plugin
  deprecated variable with the new authentication_policy variable, which provides added functionality for
  multi-factor authentication. 
* Fixed a bug where warnings indicating the use of deprecated TLS versions when connecting to a MySQL Server instance
  would show in the error log. Warnings have since been removed starting MySQL Server 8.0.28.
* Fixed a bug where the reconfiguration of a MySQL Server installation previously set to allow the TCP/IP, Shared
  Memory and Named Pipes connection protocols would result in a malformed configuration file, which in turn prevented
  protocols other than TCP/IP to work properly.
* Fixed a bug where the textbox used to filter products in the Select Products and Features page was case sensitive,
  causing searches with incorrect casing to fail to find any matching MySQL products.
  

MYSQL INSTALLER 1.4 / 1.6
--------------------

  server configuration file.
* Fixed a bug preventing the successful configuration of MySQL Server 5.6 due to a connection error after starting
  the server.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the silent option was being ignored during an upgrade operation.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the features to install were being ignored and instead all features were installed.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where a recent installation of MySQL Installer was not correctly initialized upon executing
the update command.


MYSQL INSTALLER 1.4
--------------------
1.4.38 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where the CLI failed to find the latest list of MySQL products when users attempted an upgrade.
* Fixed a bug preventing a recent manifest from being downloaded when executing the CLI update command.
* Fixed a couple of bugs where it was not possible to configure a server installation to connect using the Shared
  Memory protocol or a combination of the TCP/IP and Shared Memory protocols.
* Added support for including and excluding startup options in the options file based on the MySQL Server version
  being installed or configured.
* Fixed a bug preventing successful authentication of an Oracle SSO account when using the commercial version of
  MySQL Installer.


1.4.37 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug preventing the most recent manifest from being applied if the current installation had previously
  been upgraded to version 1.4.36.
* Fixed a bug preventing commercial versions of MySQL Installer from being able to apply a mandatory upgrade.
* Fixed a bug where attempting to upgrade a server installation that had not yet been configured would fail due
  to the list of configuration steps not being determined correctly.
* Fixed a bug where the configuration pages were not being shown after a server installation if the installation
  procedure required the server to be downloaded.


1.4.36 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where features marked as required for stand-alone MSIs were allowed to be unselected in MySQL
  Installer.
* Removed the creation of the scheduled task that checked for catalog updates. Instead, MySQL Installer now checks
  for catalog updates when the program starts and the specified number of days since the last check have passed.
* Fixed a bug where the Retry button did not perform any action when a product uninstall failed.
* Fixed a bug where the Removing Windows Firewall rules removal step was always being executed even when no
  firewall rules had been created.
* Fixed a bug where MySQL Shell closed automatically during the first run.
* Fixed a bug where the Back button was not enabled even when the download of products failed in the Download
  page.
* Updated the product installation workflow to enable the selection of features to install only when the user
  selects the "Enable the Select Features page to customize product features" option in the Select Products page.
* Updated the Server configuration file templates to include the correct default values for server variables.


1.4.35 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed server configuration types related to InnoDB cluster (Sandbox, Seed of a new InnoDB cluster and replica
of an existing InnoDB cluster). MySQL Shell is now the recommended tool for performing InnoDB cluster configurations.
* Fixed multiple broken links that prevented the access to the release notes of some MySQL products.
* Fixed a bug where the Retry button would overlap with the list of removed products in the Remove Selected Products
  page.
* Replaced mentions of master and slave with source and replica respectively.
* The Server Data Files feature is no longer available when attempting to install MySQL Server 8.0.21+.
* Removed the link to the release notes of the Documentation and Samples & Examples products in the Select Products To
  Upgrade page since release notes for said products do not exist.
* Fixed a bug where the Back button was incorrectly being enabled in the Remove Selected Products page whenever the
  Execute button was clicked.
* Fixed a bug in the Check Requirements page where the Next button was incorrectly being enabled even when no products
  met the requirements needed for installation.
* Fixed a bug where the MySQL Server configuration failed during a connection attempt due to the local computer mapping
  to multiple IP addresses.


1.4.34 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed a bug where MySQL Installer failed to release a handle on the Windows service for MySQL causing the need for a
  reboot. Additionally, a bug where the reboot check box remained hidden was corrected. Finally, added an extra
  validation to check for the existence of the Windows service for MySQL after a Server configuration or removal to
  correctly determine when a reboot is required.
* Fixed a bug where the Check For Catalog Updates check box in the MySQL Installer Options dialog was not being reset to
  its default value.
* Fixed a bug where during a Server reconfiguration the previous X Plugin firewall rule was not being removed.
* Fixed a cosmetic bug where the name of the Connector/Python product also displayed the version number.
* Fixed a bug where the creation of a InnoDB cluster instance failed for Server versions lower than 8.0.16, since
  they did not support setting a recovery method.
* Improved the implementation of InnoDB cluster operations to better handle failed configurations by reverting
  settings to the state they were before the configuration failed.
* Added an extra validation to prevent setting the same Server ID for an instance joining an existing production
  InnoDB cluster.
* Added an extra validation to ensure that a Server instance previously configured as a member of an InnoDB cluster
  is made writable prior to attempting to update its configuration.


1.4.33 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Removed from the manifest all products and series of products that are no longer supported or under
  development.
* Improved the loading of MySQL plugins by executing the SQL scripts provided with the server and executing the
  INSTALL command instead of loading the plugin via the configuration file when necessary.
* Fixed an issue where the installation of Connector/Python prevented the installation of other products.
* Fixed an issue in the CLI where providing a port number other than the default resulted in a configuration
  error.
* Fixed a bug in the CLI where the configuration options were parsed incorrectly and resulted in a null
  argument exception.
* Fixed a bug that reverted the failed icon to a success icon even when a configuration failed. This was a
  purely cosmetic issue, the configuration in question would complete successfully.
* Fixed a typo in the Check Requirements pop up window.


1.4.32 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Modified the product-remove process to show a status of "Completed (with errors)" whenever a product uninstall
  was completed, but a non-mandatory step failed to execute successfully. The label displayed on the bottom of
  the page also alludes to this and recommends reviewing the log because manual intervention may be required.
* Fixed a bug in the Router configuration page where the connection test failed to determine that MySQL Server
  is a seed instance within an InnoDB cluster. This prevented the bootstrap process from being executed.
* During a server InnoDB cluster configuration, increased the timeout seconds prior to raising an error when
  attempting to prepare MySQL Server for InnoDB cluster usage.
* Fixed a bug where the green check mark and the error icon would overlap when creating a custom user account
  during a MySQL Server with windows service configuration.
* Fixed a bug where pre-requisite check version limits were not being inclusive.
* Updated the Windows Server configuration page to also validate the service name.
* During a product upgrade, the user can click the CHANGES link to open the official documentation detailing the
  changes made to a specific version. The links for multiple products were incorrect and have since been fixed. 
* Improved pre-requisite checks by allowing MySQL Installer to also evaluate relevant rules when selecting which
  products to install. Previously, rules were only being evaluated when first launching the application.
* Fixed a couple of grammar errors in the Check Requirements wizard page.
* Fixed a bug where in certain scenarios the Finish button was not enabled after uninstalling a product.


1.4.31 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Modified the product remove process to now display a list of steps to be executed similar to the current
  configuration process.
* Modified the product reconfiguration and remove process to display a wizard page requesting user input for
  removing the data directory, removing a sandbox InnoDB cluster, or performing an action on a production InnoDB
  cluster based on the current server configuration type. These changes remove the need for popup messages in
  those cases.
* Updated the product remove process to indicate on which MySQL Server version an action such as removing the
  data directory is being taken. Previously, the popup message failed to indicate the affected server version.
* Updated the product remove process to log pre-remove and post-remove actions taken when uninstalling a product.
* MySQL Installer now warns users when they attempt to install or upgrade to a product version that is
  incompatible with a locally installed, or selected for installation, MySQL Server version.
* The License Agreement wizard page is no longer displayed when first opening MySQL Installer, instead it is
  now available in the About page. The About page now contains three sections: the About MySQL, License and
  Resources Links section.
* Improved the failure message used when configuring MySQL Server as a service and the specified user didn't have
  the required permissions to start the service.
* Updated the description for the myisam_sort_buffer_size server system variable in all .ini templates.
* Fixed a bug where verifying the root user password after an upgrade would take very long to complete.
* Fixed a bug where filtering for products using the Current GA maturity level returned incorrect results.
* Fixed a bug where the user could change the Server ID when reconfiguring a MySQL Server instance previously
  configured as part of a production InnoDB cluster. The Server ID can no longer be updated since this is
  currently not supported.
* Fixed a bug where the Reconfigure button was not visible after cancelling a reconfiguration process.
* Fixed a bug where an OperationCancelledException was being raised when attempting to reconfigure or remove a
  product after cancelling a reconfiguration process.
* Fixed a bug related to uninstalling MySQL Installer in which no Cancel button was provided in the confirmation
  dialog. In addition, pressing the Esc key also triggered MySQL Installer to uninstall.       
* Fixed a bug where the Uploads directory for a MySQL Server configuration would always be created in the default
  installation location even when the user specified a custom location.
* Fixed a bug where the configuration of MySQL Router would allow to proceed even if the connection details were
  incorrect.


1.4.30 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Display of validation errors and warnings has been standardized among all configuration pages.
 * Added the Resources Links section to the About Page, providing helpful information for users.
 * Removed support for configuring the X Plugin in pre-GA versions of MySQL Server 8.0.
 * Eliminated the possibility of adding the local instance to an InnoDB cluster residing on the same machine.
 * Added a validation to the host name field that prevents users from advancing to the next page if the server
   is not part of an InnoDB cluster.
 * Fixed a bug where an upgrade would fail if the system tables upgrade was skipped and the upgrade process
   was slow for a MySQL Server instance configured as a process.
 * Fixed a bug where switching the authentication method during a reconfiguration would fail.
 * Fixed a bug where a reconfiguration would fail when using a password with blank spaces. 
 * Fixed a bug where entering special characters in the Seconds field of the Logging Options configuration
   page blocked all other text boxes.
 * Fixed a bug where entering special characters in the Advanced Options Path field of the Advanced Options
   dialog would crash the application.


1.4.29 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added support for creating and configuring the local MySQL Server 8.0 instance as the seed of a new InnoDB
   cluster.
 * Added support for creating and adding the local MySQL Server 8.0 instance to a running InnoDB cluster on
   the network.
 * Added support for system table upgrades that are handled by the server (mysqld.exe) instead of by
   mysql_upgrade.exe starting from MySQL Server 8.0.16.
 * Fixed a bug where upgrading from MySQL Server 5.6.42 would not be possible due to missing meta data in the
   manifest.
 * Fixed a bug where attempting to configure a MySQL Server 5.7 or 8.0 installation failed with the message
   "Invalid Server Template".


1.4.28 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All UI elements have accessibility-related properties set to comply with screen narrators.
 * Unified throughout the application the look and feel of message dialogs for information, questions and
   errors.
 * Fixed an issue where the Test Connection button of the MySQL Router configuration wizard page was not
   testing the connection correctly for newer community versions of MySQL Server 5.7. SSL is enabled by
   default in commercial versions and disabled in community ones, and MySQL Installer was wrongly expecting
   SSL to be always enabled instead of just preferring it.
 * Fixed an issue using the Modify action for an installed package to add and remove features at the same time.
 * Fixed a bug where users could attempt to add MySQL users during a MySQL Server configuration (on an initial
   installation), and the MySQL User Account dialog did not enforce password confirmation.
 * Fixed a bug where Windows authenticated users could not be created during a MySQL Server configuration (on
   an initial installation); the MySQL User Account dialog did not validate Windows security tokens correctly.
 * Fixed a bug where Windows authenticated users could not be validated using Windows security tokens
   involving a Windows domain. Now Windows users can be validated on the local machine or within the domain.
   When the current Windows authenticated user isn't able to access the Active Directory of the domain the user
   can alternatively provide the credentials for a domain administrator with such privileges.
 * Fixed a bug where the MySQL User Account dialog was adding extra backslashes to the query sent to MySQL
   Server to create a Windows authenticated user when entering its Windows security tokens using double
   backslashes (as MySQL Server documentation states for Windows authenticated users). MySQL Installer was
   expecting single backslashes (as Microsoft documentation states for Windows security tokens). Now MySQL
   Installer supports entering single and double backslashes (for example, domain\user and domain\\user).
 * Fixed a problem where message dialogs would go to the back of the caller MySQL Installer windows instead
   of remaining always on top.
 * Fixed a problem where My Oracle Support options were not being enabled or disabled as expected.
 * Modified the help description for the lower_case_table_names variable in the configuration file templates of
   all applicable MySQL Server versions. The help description was misleading before, now it matches the online
   documentation.
 * Fixed the documentation link in MySQL Server 8.0 configuration file templates, it was pointing to MySQL
   Server 5.7 documentation instead of the correct MySQL Server 8.0 one.
 * Modified the documentation links for all MySQL Server configuration file templates to use https instead
   of http.
 * Added support for creating MySQL users with an empty or blank password via the MySQL User Account dialog.
 * Ensured MySQL Server does a clean shutdown after a database upgrade instead of killing the server process.
 * Made the calls to client programs like mysql, mysqladmin and mysql_upgrade more secure by avoiding to pass
   the root password on the command line and rather storing it in a configuration file in a temporary location
   just while the client program runs.


1.4.27 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added Connectivity Options to the Options dialog to configure the way MySQL Installer determines if there
   is a valid connection to the internet before attempting to download product updates. A suggested automatic
   method is offered, or a manual one where a list of links can be supplied (and modified) to check if a
   connection to any of them can be established.
 * Ensured that navigation of all the product by keyboard is possible and that the flow is natural.
 * Fixed a bug where the Windows pipe name on a Server re-configuration was being incorrectly changed.
 * Ensured the log file paths are validated during a Server configuration, so no invalid values can be saved
   to the configuration file.
 * The Server Samples and Examples and Server Documentation product packages are no longer installed on a
   client-only setup, since the installation and configuration of those products are dependant on an installed
   Server.
 * Modified the flow of an initial installation of MySQL Installer to always show the Add Products wizard if
   no products are initially installed and MySQL Installer is closed. This also ensures that if MySQL
   Installer is closed without accepting the License Agreement, the License Agreement page is the very first
   page shown when MySQL Installer is opened again.
 * Fixed a bug where a Server configuration was attempting to remove a Windows Firewall rule with the default
   TCP/IP port (3306) or the default X Plugin port (33060) before creating new Windows Firewall rules for the
   configured port numbers (which may differ from the default ones). This problem was causing that if another
   Server installation used those ports, the Windows Firewall rules were deleted incorrectly.
 * Fixed some warnings displayed during Server startup related to the read_buffer_size and
   read_rnd_buffer_size variables not being set with proper default values. Now the values are set correctly
   during an initial Server configuration.
 * Ensured that the binary log is enabled during a Server configuration, for versions (like 8.0.x) that
   suggest the binary log is enabled by default.
 * Ensured that deprecated/invalid Server variables are removed from the Server configuration file during a
   Server upgrade or during a Server reconfiguration.
 * Fixed an unhandled exception that was preventing MySQL Installer to upgrade itself when a new version of
   Installer was detected and automatically downloaded for installation.
 

 1.4.26 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed a bug that was not setting the native authentication plugin when configuring a Sandbox InnoDB
   cluster. Now the mysql_native_authentication_plugin is set for root and cluster related sandbox user
   accounts.
 * The Advanced Configuration options screen is split into two screens: Logging Options and Advanced Options.
   The first screen contains all the fields related with logging and the advanced options will contain the
   server ID and radio button options to choose which value will be set for lower_case_table_names server
   option. In the case of 8.0 servers this value must not be changed after database is initialized.
 * Set screen dimensions fixed on Authentication Method configuration screen so it is not affected when
   changing DPI configuration on OS and the Next button is visible.
 * Fixed an error that was not allowing to add Windows authenticated users when configuring the Server. Now
   it is possible to add them in the Accounts and Roles screen.
 * Since Server 8.0.11 the X Protocol is integrated on the Server product so there is no need to configure it
   as a plugin.
 * Now on Server 8.0.11 and newer the Plugins and Extentions configuration screen is removed and the MySQL X
   Protocol Port field is moved to the Type and Networking configuration screen. For previous Server versions
   that support X Protocol Plugin the configuration screens doesn't change.
 * Fixed the Enterprise Firewall failure when configuring the Server.
 * Fixed a bug that automatically selects 32 bit packages instead of 64 bit ones when selecting an option
   different from Custom on the Install Type configuration screen for 64 bit bundles. Now the correct 64-bit
   packages are automatically selected.
 * Fixed a bug that was not allowing to add custom users when configuring 5.5 and 5.6 Server versions.
 / Added funtionallity to configure the Enterprise Firewall after its installation. Now after the plugin is
   installed successfully it is configured to run on recording mode for the root and the custom user accounts.


 1.4.25 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Removed the NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER value assigned to the sql-mode server variable from the configuration file
   template for the 8.0 series. The NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER value was already deprecated in previous Server
   versions and finally removed in 8.0.11.
 * Fixed configuration file templates in sections specific to the socket, default-character-set,
   character-set-server and innodb_data_home_dir which were written to the configuration file with a wrong
   value of 0.0.


 1.4.24 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A new configuration page titled "Authentication Plugin" is shown starting with MySQL 8.0.4, since the
   default authentication method has been changed from that version onwards to the caching_sha2_password
   authentication plugin. The new page advertises the default authentication method change and its
   consequences during package installation and give the user a possibility to change back to an
   authentication method that also works with old clients.
 * A new warning dialog is shown when upgrading from a milestone (pre- GA) MySQL Server release, to warn about
   the risks of continuing (compatibility issues, or Server not starting at all) and about having to perform
   some manual steps instead of just upgrading. The release notes of MySQL Server contain a disclaimer about
   the upgrades from milestone releases, so now MySQL Installer shows the warning to users with all required
   information to perform the needed manual steps instead. Users are able to proceed with the upgrade at their
   own risk.
 * MySQL Installer is now using .NET Framework 4.5.2, so this is a prerequisite.
 * The configuration page where users can choose to setup a sandbox InnoDB cluster is now available for MySQL
   8.0. The configuration of InnoDB cluster is no longer available on 32-bit operating systems. MySQL
   Installer disables the option of configuring a sandbox InnoDB cluster if installing on Windows 32-bit.
 * MySQL Installer has two new options "Install All Products" and "Only install GA Products" in the "Choosing
   a Setup Type" page, which are shown only if the current Server bundle includes at least one pre-GA package
   and if the selected setup type is Developer Default, Client only or Full.
 * The "Install All Products" option allows the installation of pre-GA packages included in the bundle.
 * Fixed a bug happening where a Server 32-bit was not found in the current bundle and was causing the MySQL
   Installer not to look anymore for other 32-bit (or architecture ANY) client packages. Now even if a Server
   32-bit is not in the current bundle and the setup type is supposed to return other client packages, those
   are successfully returned. Improved the message shown to users if there are no packages found, so it is
   clearer to understand why the message is being shown.
 * The commercial edition of the MySQL Installer is including now an InnoDB Cluster admin tools that do not
   require any prerequisites to be used. The community edition of the MySQL Installer includes admin tools
   that do require a VC++ runtime to be installed. Starting from this version of MySQL Installer, if the
   prerequisite is not already installed, the option to configure a sandbox InnoDB Cluster is disabled. If
   disabled a link is shown from which a dialog to resolve the prerequisite can be accessed.
 * Fixed a problem that was preventing the MySQL Installer from finding related Documentation and Samples
   and Examples packages for MySQL Server 8.0.
 * Fixed a problem where MySQL Installer was overwriting older settings in the configuration file during a
   MySQL Server upgrade.
 * The server_character_set and default_character_set options are commented in the configuration files
   produced by MySQL Installer. This allows the MySQL Server to use the default value for those 2 options
   appropriate for the Server version being configured. If the default values need to change, the values must
   be assigned manually by editing the configuration file.
 * Product requirements are no longer installed multiple times, when a requirement is about to be downloaded
   it checks if it has been already fulfilled and if so the status is correctly reflected.
 * Now the requirements list is cleared and recalculated correctly when going back and forth between the
   Setup Types and the Requirements panels.
 * Configuration steps only appear in the configuration summary panel if they are really needed. Steps will
   no longer appear with an "if necessary" suffix, since if they appear in the list is because they are needed
   and will perform actions.
 * Fixed a problem where MySQL Server instances were being re-added to the list everytime the configuration
   page for Samples and Wxamples was shown.
 * The configuration step that updates the Windows firewall runs "netsh firewall" or "netsh advfirewall"
   depending on the Windows version, where the latter is supported it is run instead of the former.


 1.4.23 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Enhanced the prerequisite checks for the VC++ 2008 redistributable runtime, related to MySQL Server 5.5, so
   it can detect different versions of the redistributable. The 2008 redistributable does not have a more
   generic single way of detection like newer versions of it.
 * Fixed a bug in the calculation of values performed during the Server configuration that depend on the
   "Config Type" (Development / Server / Dedicated) when the format for numbers differ from the American
   standard (i.e. commas are used for decimal separator, period used for thousands separator).
 * Set configuration steps propertly on command line interface, when configuring a MySQL Server so it is
   initialized, and started successfully.
 * Added checks during the Samples & Examples product configuration to only start MySQL Server instances that
   were not previously running, and only shut those started instances down.


 1.4.22 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added support for the caching_sha2_password plugin used in MySQL Server versions 8.0.4 and greater. This is
   needed during Server configuration to be able to start the Server, which uses SHA2 password caching instead
   of native authentication as in previous Server versions.


 1.4.21 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Enabled TLS 1.2 protocol for all downloads made by the MySQL Installer for Windows.
 * Set screen dimensions fixed on configuration screens so they are not affected when changing DPI
   configuration on OS and the Next button is visible.
 * When doing a sandbox InnoDB cluster configuration, the shortcuts created by the MySQL Installer to open the
   CLI use the configuration file of the seed instance created by the configuration process.
 * Removed the configuration panels that asks users for a sandbox InnoDB cluster's password. This was needed
   to gracefully stop the sandbox cluster before attempting to do a classic configuration and to start the
   sandbox cluster after the classic configuration was finished. There is no longer a need to stop and start
   the sandbox cluster for the classic configuration to take place.
 * Fixed a bug in the code that checks prerequisites in the Windows Registry that was happening only in 32-bit
   versions of Windows.
 * Changed the Visual Studio detection rules, needed to install MySQL for Visual Studio, to check for the
   following registry keys: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VisualStudio.DTE.X.Y (where X.Y stands for the supported
   versions of Visual Studio, currently 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0 and 15.0).
 * Fixed a but where the Install path was overwritten by its default value every time Configuration screen was
   loaded. Now the default Install path value is set correctly only once.
 * Made changes to the configuration page where MySQL Server instances compatible with the version of the
   Samples and Examples product are shown, so that these instances are properly identified as stand-alone or
   InnoDB cluster ones, and so that more information about them is shown to users. Also, it is now possible to
   install the sample databases on multiple instances from this screen. The screen has a filter to hide MySQL
   Server instances that may be running in read-only mode, which may be replica instances in an InnoDB cluster,
   since data cannot be created in those.
 * Fixed the detection rules for the Visual Studio Tools for Office needed to install MySQL for Excel.
   The rules were changed to check a Windows Registry key in the Registry32 view instead of the Default one.
 * Changed all VC++ runtime download links to point to the latest versions released by Microsoft including the
   one that fixes an error where an older VC++ 64-bit runtime was causing problems needing to install its
   corresponding 32-bit version as well. With these latest VC++ runtime versions that is no longer necessary.
 * Added a password verification box to the sandbox InnoDB cluster configuration page. Also added visual aid
   to report the password strength. This makes it consistent to the way a root password is supplied for the
   stand-alone Server configuration.
 * Added a validation to disallow empty or blank usernames added in the Accounts and Roles section of a MySQL
   Server configuration.
 * Fixed a cosmetic problem where the configuration log was showing messages when Windows Firewall ports were
   being opened, but the messages were showing incorrect port numbers.
 * Fixed a bug where the MySQL Installer was trying to start a stand-alone MySQL Server instance during a
   sandbox InnoDB cluster configuration.
 * Changed the way the Automatic Catalog Update process runs, it now runs using a system account which enables
   the hiding of the process window correctly. This version of the MySQL Installer will patch an existing
   Windows scheduled task related to the catalog update process to fix this behavior.
 * Fixed a problem with passwords containing special characters like ";", so that they are processed and sent
   to the MySQL Server correctly.
 * Fixed a problem where the MySQL Windows Authentication plugin was not being added to the configuration file
   when Windows authenticated users are added during the Server configuration.
 * Enhanced the way the MySQL Installer overrides install locations defined in custom property values like
   INSTALL_ROOT. This fixes a specific problem with MySQL Shell MSIs using INSTALL_ROOT to set the default
   install location.
 * Fixed the link to the MySQL Shell release notes displayed in the main dashboard of the MySQL Installer.
 * Fixed the permissions the Automatic Catalog Update process needs so it can modify an already existing
   product catalog when updates are available. This version of the MySQL Installer will patch an existing
   Windows scheduled task related to the catalog update process to fix this behavior.
 * Fixed a bug where the MySQL Installer was incorrectly processing a found catalog update, causing error
   messages. Now when new products are found during a catalog update, only the required information is
   processed.
 * Enabled the automatic scrollbars for the text view of the product catalog update.
 * Fixed a value in the configuration file for MySQL Server 5.5 installations so that the value of
   MAX_ALLOWED_PACKET is set in the same way it is set for 5.6 and newer versions of the MySQL Server.
 * Fixed a bug when upgrading a Server version previously configured as a sandbox InnoDB cluster. Now during
   the upgrade configuration an explanation text will be shown with an option to recreate the sandbox cluster.
   The mysql_upgrade tool will not be run against each instance of the sandbox cluster as per design, since
   the sandbox cluster is for testing purposes only. So for the sake of ensuring a sandbox cluster will
   continue working with a new Server version, the suggested option is to destroy the cluster and create it
   again. If recreating the cluster is not chosen at this point, users will be responsible of recreating the
   cluster or running mysql_upgrade on every instance of the sandbox cluster manually.
 * Removed from the INI file templates entries related to InnoDB cluster configuration that are invalid to
   start the Server. These settings were, in previous versions, commented out but since they are really not
   valid values the Server understands, the settings should not be kept in that file. These values are now
   stored in a file called installer_config.xml, found in the same location as the regular Server
   configuration file.


 1.4.20 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The query_cache_size and query_cache_type variables were removed from the my.ini configuration file
   templates for MySQL Server 5.7 and 8.0, since they were deprecated and if present cause errors preventing
   the Server from starting.
 * Replaced the table_cache variable with table_open_cache in the my.ini configuration file templates for
   MySQL Server 5.1 and 5.5, in the same way the variable has been already replaced in previous MySQL
   Installer versions for Server 5.6 and greater.
 * Fixed the detection of 32-bit prerequisites on 64-bit Windows environments when a 64-bit version of the
   prerequisite was already present.
 * Fixed the detection of Python 3.5 which even when installed for All Users it creats in the Windows Registry
   keys in the CURRENT_USER hive instead of creating them in the LOCAL_MACHINE one.
 * Fixed the detection of Python for the cases where the product is installed for the current user only.


 1.4.19 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Added support to configure an InnoDB cluster sandbox test setup consisting of three, five, seven, or nine
   MySQL server instances. InnoDB cluster requires MySQL 5.7.17 or higher.
 * Added support to install and configure MySQL Router 2.1.3 or later as a local Windows service.
 * Links to MySQL for Visual Studio feature documentation shown in the MySQL Installer dashboard did not
   connect properly to the product information.
 * The text box with the log of actions performed at the end of the configuration steps for a recently
   installed MySQL server accepted text input.
 * This fix ensures that the log is read-only and can be copied.


 1.4.18 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The plugins are now loaded directly from the my.ini file, simplifying the process.
 * The scheduled task is now created to be periodically executed at the very hour the installer is run for the
   first time.


 1.4.17 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The correct message is now displayed when no internet connection is available instead of displaying the
   generic message of "Invalid credentials".
 * Manifest was updated and it now shows all the latest version of products.
 * When updating the Catalog it didn't accurately displayed the latest update date which is now fixed.
 * On commercial editions, the password is now validated correclty on the first screen and we also display a
   message specific to problems with the internet connection additional to the generic one for "Invalid
   credentials".
 * The problem that prevented users from downloading Connector C from the archive was fixed.
 * There was a problem that prevented you from downloading and installing MySQL 5.6.29 GPL from the internet
   which is now fixed.
 * When deleting "%ProgramData%\MySQL\MySQL Installer for Windows\Manifest\Templates\my-template-5.7.ini"
   and installing a 5.7 server the default "my-template.ini" should be enough to get the server started.
 * A problem with the registry keys created an invalid state for MySQL Installer where two intallers from the
   same version could be registered in the system at the same time. This is now fixed and should no longer occur.


 1.4.16 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Enhanced the reconfigure process to allow my.ini updates avoiding loss of custom configuration values.


 1.4.15 Bugs Fixed / Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed problem with missing registry keys for local machine.
 * Added a new configuration page for MySQL Server plugins, available when installing Server versions 5.7.12
